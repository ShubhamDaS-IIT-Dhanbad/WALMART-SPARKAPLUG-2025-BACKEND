If you want something simple, up to date, and reliable while also not wanting to do monthly payments this is perfect for that. It can do everything the newer phones can do without all the fancy things if you don't need them or use them. 

Bought two for my kids and they work great.

This item was not in like new excellent refurbished condition as advertised, so I returned it.  Unfortunately, this is still not showing up as returned in the app and I have not yet received the credit back to my account.  It's my hope that Walmart eventually gets up to par with Amazon in regards to their online platform and returns.
