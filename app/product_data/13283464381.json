I had never used it, nor had I put a SIM card in it. A few days later, I returned it to a Walmart in Syracuse. The experience shocked me. I paid $547 for a used phone, but it was almost new, as the website said, not a phone that looked like it had been in the war. Even now, more than a week later, I have not received my money back. Too bad! By the way, I documented the opening of the box and shipping bag when it arrived at my house.\n\n All parts of the screen have scratches, but there are 2 parts that look like the screen is broken from being so hard.",
