**Awesome headphones** (‚≠ê 5 by Safiya)  
It's a great pair of headphones reasonably priced the sound is exquisite. It's waterproof because I already dropped it in the sink.Lol it's cool looking it has a digital screen. It keeps charge for very long maybe past 24 hours depending on how you use it but it's great. I do recommend.

**Can't here me talking???** (‚≠ê 1 by PincheBen)  
If you only want to listen to music or podcasts, these will work for you.  if you want to have a conversation with others, these do not work very well at all.  I have folks telling me all the time they can't hear me it comes out muffled, sounds like i'm far away, etc.

I take them out and all of a sudden the call is clear.

I'm not very happy with these at all!
