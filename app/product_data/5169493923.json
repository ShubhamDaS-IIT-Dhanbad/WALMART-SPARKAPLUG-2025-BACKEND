On the corner of the phone with the camera, it seems to have been damaged before. The outer layer of paint around the camera lens came off a bit, and there was a small dent in that corner.\n\nFinally, the battery health was 83%.\n\nActually, I didn't even notice it was the wrong product at first, and I was going to keep it despite its imperfections until I saw 83% battery health which is very close to the lowest possible threshold. Then, I checked the shipping label again and it said good.\n\nI didn't want to be too mean, but I can't recommend the wrong product. I contacted seller about a different issue before receiving the product, and they seem like nice people, so I don't know if this was a one off or something.\n\nThe return process seems to be relatively straightforward though.\nJust buy at your own risk, and don't put your expectations too high.",
