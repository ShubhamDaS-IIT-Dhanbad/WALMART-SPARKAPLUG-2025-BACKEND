This bad battery defeats the whole purpose of where no matter how good the phone looks I can't use it all day on a single charge \ud83d\udeab. I literally have to turn my phone off when I'm not using it or it will drain. Anyhow I decided that I would  swap the battery out myself to fix \"their\" problem \"IF AND ONLY IF\"  they would refund me enough money to purchase the new battery and these dudes said no \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.  With that being said it was obvious at this point I was going to return the phone. These guys should be checking their phones before sending them out and it was quite obvious they didn't check mine before sending it out to me resulting in a waste of time for me only to buy another phone one elsewhere. Long story short, this may be your experience buying a phone with these guys \"UNLESS\" they decide to start checking their phones prior to sending them out. Good luck!",

Reebelo would not even offer an apology, but assured me that my experience would be better if purchasing from them in the future.

The battery on the other hand  had a Maximum Capacity of 74% \ud83e\udeab. In their description the MINIMUM is suppose to be at a Maximum Capacity of 80%. This bad battery defeats the whole purpose of where no matter how good the phone looks I can't use it all day on a single charge \ud83d\udeab. I literally have to turn my phone off when I'm not using it or it will drain. Anyhow I decided that I would  swap the battery out myself to fix \"their\" problem \"IF AND ONLY IF\"  they would refund me enough money to purchase the new battery and these dudes said no \ud83e\udd26\ud83c\udffd\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.  With that being said it was obvious at this point I was going to return the phone. These guys should be checking their phones before sending them out and it was quite obvious they didn't check mine before sending it out to me resulting in a waste of time for me only to buy another phone one elsewhere. Long story short, this may be your experience buying a phone with these guys \"UNLESS\" they decide to start checking their phones prior to sending them out. Good luck!",

The product invoice that I received even says that the product is in \"good\" condition and is black which are both entirely different than what I ordered.  Reebelo would not even offer an apology, but assured me that my experience would be better if purchasing from them in the future.  They did offer to discount the item by $10 which is a joke since we know that there is about a $70-$100 price difference in the price of good and a like new product.",
