**Amazed with high quality** (‚≠ê 5 by Julie K.)  
This little Bluetooth earbuds carry out respectable for the rate factor. However the best feature of this is the battery life - it holds the cost for an actually long period of time! Providing it five stars for that alone! The microphone is not the best, however I really bought this for exercising and when I intend to pay attention to music while out and about, so the durability is what provides me much more value. If you're looking for a respectable Bluetooth ear buds with fantastic battery life, then certainly offer this set a shot!
