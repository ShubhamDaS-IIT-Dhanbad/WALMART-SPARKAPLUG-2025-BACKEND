**** (‚≠ê 5 by Haromis)  
I absolutely love my new phone. It doesn't have any issues at all. It was pretty easy to connect to my cell phone company. I don't have any issues with it. It does like to overheat occasionally, but that's only when charging so it's really not an issue for me as well. It did come with the wrong charger, but I didn't find too much of an issue with that. I just went and bought another one. I did see other bad reviews, but I think it is worth a buy and if it does turn out to be bad or anything like that, you can always return it

**Walmart customer service is beyond disappointing.** (‚≠ê 1 by B)  
Wish I could give a review of the physical item, but I never received it. I paid for this item, then it was ‚Äúshipped‚Äù on May 26th. As of today I still have not received this item and it has not moved via the tracking number. Fed ex states they do not have the package. Clearly, it's lost. Walmart customer service was less than helpful the multiple times I had to call to try and resolve this issue. All I wanted was a replacement item shipped to me overnight. Seeing as the item was supposed to be here last Thursday and today is Tuesday, that seemed like a reasonable request. I was informed they could not do that. All they could do was cancel the order, refund my money and reorder the item.. the refund, mind you, takes 7-10 business days to get back to my account. Seems like it would be easier for everyone to just replace the item, but nope. Why would I ever risk reordering a high dollar item when the customer service is this terrible.. Just don't. You're better off ordering from literally anywhere else. Walmart used to be known for great customer service. I hate to say that's not the case anymore. The rep told me that my situation could not be escalated and when I asked for a corporate complaint number he said he didn't have one to get out. Save yourself the headache and time.
