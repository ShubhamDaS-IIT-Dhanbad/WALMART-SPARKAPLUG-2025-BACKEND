**Check your provider before buying! Unlocked! So!** (‚≠ê 1 by Ronald)  
I purchased 2 of these. If you have Spectrum. Run! Don't buy! They are not compatible! I spent all day with going to the Spectrum store, Samsung chat, and Spectrum online. Now I am at the mercy of the FAMOUS delivery system to get my money back somehow!
